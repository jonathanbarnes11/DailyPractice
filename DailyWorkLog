  Learning Node http://www.nodebeginner.org/
  Purchased the node beginner book. The free portion seemed very thorough and easy to understand. Had the right details at the right time.

  Learning Node Stopped on Page 24 of 56.

Thursday Jan 12
  Learning stopped on page 29 0f 56.

Wednesday Jan 18
  Starting practicing and got really annoyed that the IDE was helping with anything. Went down a two hour rabbit hole on IDE configuration. Totally worth it. Atom has a terminal, an auto-complete feature, and I properly setup linting. It now feels like a real IDE. I'm surprised at how difficult it was to get working properly and how long it took. Seems like you should be able download a base setup for node development with everything working

  Stopped on Page 42 of 56 (did some work I didn't check in over the weekend)
